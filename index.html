      <p>Hello there,</p> 
      <p>You find here a little presentation of free-time projects that I did. 
        It includes the website itself, along with one (some more are in development) image 
        processing project and some nice picture of my travel around the world. All this is 
        just for a little fun, keep learning, keep improving and do something productive. I am a Biomedical Engineer with a strong interest in software development and more 
        particularly image processing. I am happy to answer any questions, you can contact me via the canals, LinkedIn, Github
        or mail. The links are located on the bottom right corner of the page.</p>
        <p> At this point, I am just writting dummy content in order that the page does not
        look empty. Don't mind me, here is some metaphysical thoughts: I don't have any metaphysical
        thoughts right now unfortunately... This is usually the case but not right now.
      </p>
      <p>Okey I have the "white page syndrome", I will just copy and past some crap: 
        Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established neurosurgical
        treatment for Parkinson's disease. The preferred target in the
        subcortex is the subthalamic nucleus. In clinical routine, the
        search of the optimal stimulation parameters is a time consuming (up
        to 8 hours per patient) trial-and-error method. 
        DBS parameters optimization based on probabilistic stimulation
        mapping may reduce the duration of this process and improve the
        outcome of the therapy, thus benefiting both clinician and patients.
        Previous studies developed methods using estimation of the volume of
        tissue activated and processing voxel-wise significance tests to
        find a sweet spot. They could demonstrate that it positively
        correlates with clinical improvement. This work aimed to refine
        existing probabilistic stimulation maps.
        The state-of-the-art methods were implemented in a MATLAB class
        allowing fast implementation of new algorithms. A multicentric
        dataset of patients from Bern and Cologne centers was used to train
        and test the models. The proposed methods consisted in regularized...
